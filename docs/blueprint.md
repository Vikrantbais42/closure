# **App Name**: Project Closure Notice

## Core Features:

- Text Display: Clearly display the provided message regarding the project closure due to non-payment. Message content: 'The Owner of this project is not paying remaining amount of 108000 due to this, Saat Phere project is closed and will never come online again, Client Name - Manoj Kumar, Address - Vijay Nagar Chauraha Etawah'.
- Contact Information Display: Provide a section (if necessary) to display contact information related to the announcement for inquiries.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep, desaturated blue (#3B5998) to evoke seriousness and trust, yet also provide a somber feel.
- Background color: Very light desaturated blue (#E8F0FE) for a clean, unobtrusive backdrop.
- Accent color: Desaturated purple (#8E44AD) for any necessary calls to action or highlighting of contact details, to stand out from the primary blue while remaining tonally consistent.
- Font: 'Inter', sans-serif, for a modern, readable, and neutral appearance in the main text.
- Ensure content is centered for optimal viewing.
- Use a simple, somber icon (e.g., a closed lock) to visually represent the closure.
